Final Readme Comp 20 
Jacob Watton

1. The purpose of this git repository is to have a source for all of the skills we applied in comp 20. It serves as a reminder for simpler topics
   and also could be enhanced and used for professional use. Git provides a service in which several people can develop or view information at the  
   same time (for instance Ming when he grades) and it takes care of the fear of losing large chunks of code due to continuously pushing your work.

2. My favorite assignment was assignment 3, the server side for the Marauder's map. Building web applications is very interesting to me and 
   building JSON-based API's was very cool. I also enjoyed working with MongoDB because I had some small database experience prior to the class
   however I had never used a database in an application so I discovered that I'd like to take the databases class as one of my electives.

3. I feel like I have grown a lot since day one. I was skeptical about taking comp 20 because I didn't think I would be interested in web development. 
   I still am not a big fan of making things look nice in HTML but creating API's and incorporating databases helped me gain a sneak peak into a few
   topics that I would like to learn more about in the near future. Before this class I knew absolutely nothing about web development and I feel
   like I have learned a considerable amount.  

4. I think the most important thing I learned in this course is that a lot of things are already done for you. It is something repeated over and over
   again but, especially via uses of the google maps API in the Marauder's map project and the yummly API I am using in my final project, I have 
   learned that the use of outside code is absolutely crucial. While you obviously need to have an overarching idea that incorporates the 
   other code that is not too similar, using other APIs fights security risk and saves tons of time.  

5. I'd love to delve deeper into building web applications and potentially some security work. My answer to number two talks about my interest in web 
   applications. The cross-site scripting topic and finding loopholes to buy a 99 cent flat screen tv was very interesting. I think that security
   would be fun because the idea is just that you get to go in and hack at something over and over again, and who doesn't like breaking things. I
   also view it as a bit of a competition between IT security and the hacker so by my competitive nature I think being involved in IT security 
   could be a lot of fun.
