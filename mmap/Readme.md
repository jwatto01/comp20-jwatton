Comp 20 Assignment 2

What has been implemented correctly: Everything seems to be implemented correctly without any JS errors.
Initially I had a problem with other users showing up, however that was because I was using my own
user name instead of the one that Ming emailed me, a pretty simple mistake. 

Collaborations: I used Ming's example on the tuftsdev/Webprogramming github for finding myself on the
google map api and I used the stack overflow page to construct the distance between two points. 

Time spent: I spent 3-4 hours on this assignment.
